## FSD Architecture Principles

- Organize the project using Feature-Sliced Design (FSD):
  1. **App** – Application entry point, global providers, routing, theming, and store setup.
  2. **Pages** – Route-based pages containing layout + widgets/features/entities.
  3. **Features** – Independent user-facing features (e.g., SearchBar, LoginButton).
  4. **Entities** – Domain objects with related state, UI, and logic (e.g., User, Product).
  5. **Shared** – Global reusable code: UI components, hooks, helpers, constants, API clients.

## Rules to Follow

- Place new code in the correct FSD layer according to its role.
- Keep imports directional: upper layers can import from lower layers, not vice versa.
- Avoid placing business logic in `shared` or `app`.
- Each slice should be self-contained with its own UI, logic, and styles.
- Use index files for public API of each slice, hide internal modules.
